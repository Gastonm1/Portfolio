    <h4>My Story</h4>
    <p>
      Prior to pivoting my career towards software development, I worked at a
      law firm in the Chicago metropolitan area. My attention ability to quickly
      learn and meticulous attention to detail helped me excel at the firm but I
      longed for something that would allow me to express my creative side and
      utilize love to solve problems. As a result, I longed for a more
      challenging career that would allow me to grow and develop as a creative
      professional. <br />
      After some introductory, online classes (codeacaedemy, udemy) I was
      hooked; I knew software engineering was the career path for me. In
      September 2018, I enrolled in Northwestern University's intensive
      Fullstack coding program. Here, I have acquired the skills to become
      proficient in Fullstack development. With this program involving over 250+
      hours of in-class learning through an extensive curriculum along with 200+ hours of
      independent learning to understand the material; I anticipate graduation
      from the Fullstack Development program in May 2019. While, I am confident
      in my newfound skill set, education and teaching experiences from
      Northwestern University, I am looking for an opportunity to grow as a
      developer while utilizing my professional experience of working in a team
      environment. <br />
      I have experience in implementation and testing for small to large scale
      applications including in sustaining small and large scale applications
      with constant updates via GitHub. I strive to create the best experience
      for the customer in the form of usable and reliable software. My
      specialties include frontend integration along with user experience and
      interaction along via Javascript along with data manipulation via MongoDB and/or MySQL.
